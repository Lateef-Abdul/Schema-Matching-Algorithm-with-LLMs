Parker, who purports to be an oil tycoon, visits the general store owned by Lum Edwards and Abner Peabody, and offers them $20,000 in cash for their property. Though Parker stirs the town's interest by using a fake divining rod to prove that there is oil in Pine Ridge, Lum believes that Parker is trying to underbid them, and sends a warning to Pine Ridge land owners not to sell to him. Among those taking heed of Lum's warning is Abigail, who has been in love with Lum for many years and wants to marry him. Leading the effort to exploit the town's supposed oil reserves, Lum organizes the Pine Ridge Oil and Development Co. and holds a town meeting to persuade the residents to begin drilling the oil themselves. Lum succeeds in getting the townspeople to pool their property and mortgage it for money to build the first oil well, and a ceremony is held to commemorate its opening. Attired in raincoats to guard against spewing oil, the entire town anxiously awaits the explosion that promises to bring the oil gush. The explosion, however, results in nothing more than disappointment, as it is quickly determined that there is no oil to be found below the surface. The development company digs deeper and deeper for oil, and eventually goes broke. Hoping to get an investment from the man who started the Pine Ridge oil craze, Lum and Abner go to Chicago to meet with Parker. At Parker's office, Jimmy Benton, an employee of Parker's chief competitor, overhears Lum and Abner discuss the oil at Park Ridge. Intent on beating Parker to the oil boom, Jimmy rushes to get in on the Park Ridge deal. Jimmy makes the Pine Ridge storekeepers a lucrative offer for their land, but his offer is bettered by Mr. Clarke, Parker's partner, who is not aware that the Park Ridge oil boom is a hoax. Returning to Park Ridge with more money than the town invested in the oil scheme, Lum and Abner pay back the residents, and Parker is left holding the deed to worthless land.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036871/,"['Charles E.

Down on his luck with a profitless whale attraction, Nicky, at heart a songwriter, tries to audition for vaudeville agent Axel Hanratty, who turns him out. In Hanratty's offices, however, Nicky meets blonde singer Lily Racquel. Lily, impressed with Nicky's song, asks him to drum up a vaudeville act with her and gives him a ring to hock to purchase an act. Instead, Nicky, a compulsive gambler and foolish idealist, loses Lily's money shooting craps with Hanratty, then tells her he bought the act. Joe, his band, Sailor and Jackie then abandon Nicky's outfit, and Joe borrows Lily for his nightclub act. Nicky and Lily improve the lyrics on his song and swear their love; however, in an attempt to win back Lily's ring so he can propose, Nicky loses both it and the song to Hanratty. During Joe's opening show at the Yellow Dragon Cafe, Lily sings Nicky's song, and Hanratty, in the audience with radio man Alvin Ritchie, decides to hire the band and the girl. When Ritchie offers Lily a chance to sing the song on a radio broadcast, she insists Nicky be included, but Hanratty reminds her he now owns the song. Lily turns her back on Nicky, and she and Joe replace gossip columnist Larry Hale's ""Broadway Chatter"" segment on Ritchie's radio program and are a big success. Joe then advances to the Varsity Club, a collegiate bar, and finally opens his own nightclub, the Club Kent. Ritchie, meanwhile, courts Lily, while Nicky works at a flea circus, slowly earning enough money to buy back Lily's ring. When she receives it, she visits Nicky, who tells her he doesn't want her back and is leaving for Iowa in the morning, to join the Bartow Wonder Shows. The Countess then convinces Nicky to spend his last night in New York with the old gang at Joe's opening at Club Kent. There, Ritchie has Joe announce his engagement to Lily, whom he expects to give up her work after marriage. When Nicky hears the announcement, he runs out. Hale then learns of the old romance between Nicky and Lily and approaches Nicky for fuel for his scandal sheet, but Nicky socks him and he lands in the hospital. Struck by Nicky's love for Lily, Hale turns soft and uses his broadcasting powers to blackmail Ritchie into backing out of the marriage.

Fearing he will disgrace the family name if he stays in New York, the father sends him to San Francisco to work in the family shipyards and, to make a man out of him, he is told he will have to start at the bottom and work his way up. Henry decides this is not a good idea and resents it to the point he will indeed start at the bottom but will work his way down from there, and disgrace the family name in San Francisco. On one of his drinking binges, he meets Marcelle, a cabaret dancer. He tolerates her and she falls in love with him and pleads for him to give up his drinking and carousing. The father sends a company-man out to check on him and he finds Henry an alcoholic and very much in debt. He pays off Henry's debts and then pays a freighter captain $500 to shanghai Henry to Shanghai, where the family name is less well-known. There Henry sinks even lower and frequents the worse dives in the worse sections of the city. He offers to buy a drink for a girl in an opium den and the girl turns out to be Marcelle. But Marcelle has changed a bit since he last saw her, and she is now hooked on drugs and is less inclined to harp on Henry about his drinking and/or carousing. But they decide they truly love each other, and begin the long, uphill fight back to respectability together, with the codicil that if he takes a drink or Marcelle uses a needle, the other is free to leave. Their regeneration path is so good that, a year later, they own a pineapple ranch outside Honolulu and making good. Henry's family, none too approving of Marcelle, shows up and asks him to return to New York where his father is gravely ill. Henry, because he thinks Marcelle needs him more, refuses.

They are also encouraged to pass the cameras along to get as many Iraqis across the country to participate in this project as possible. The cameras are in circulation from April to September 2004, shortly after the American bombing of Fallujah and the fall of the dictatorial regime of Saddam Hussein; the resulting footage was compiled to become this film. Most of the subjects talk about issues around Hussein versus the Americans, and whether their lives and of Iraqis in general are better off now or then, their thoughts about democracy in general and how it applies to Iraq, and what they want to see for their future. A few also steer clear of politics altogether, wanting to focus on happier things. As the cameras move around the country, regional differences emerge, such as the Kurds of the north, who were persecuted by Hussein, having a unique perspective. Differences also emerge based on individual exposure to Hussein and/or his associates, or to what recently occurred in Fallujah. This digital camera footage is interspersed with other videos, including propaganda video by jihadis, and found unofficial videos recorded by Hussein's regime documenting their actions while in power, and with western media headlines about the Iraqi situation which has largely shaped the western view of life in Iraq.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430745/,['People of Iraq'],"['People of Iraq', 'Martin Kunert']",['People of Iraq'],,"$30,634","$57,999","$57,999",2004-10-29,"['United States', 'Iraq']",['Iraq'],"['Booya Studios', 'Voices of Freedom LLC']",,"['Documentary', 'War']","['Arabic', 'English', 'Kurdish']"

tt0047524,The Steel Cage,1h 20m,Approved,6.4,50,,"Warden Clinton T. Duffy of San Quentin penitentiary introduces three short stories about prison life: Prisoner Billy Brenner, a gourmet, is dismayed to discover that Louis, the prison's head chef, is about to be paroled and offers him two hundred dollars a week to stay. However, Louis leaves and obtains a position as chef at a high-class restaurant where his girl friend Marie also works. One evening, a very particular customer visits the restaurant and Louis suggests a special dinner. When the customer is not totally pleased with the first course, Louis, who has a problem controlling his temper, manages to remain calm. After another course is rejected, Louis presents his coq-au-vin specialty whereupon the customer brings out a bottle of ketchup and slathers it over the dish. This enrages Louis, who then smashes a plate over the customer's head, thereby breaking not only the plate, but also the conditions of his parole. After Louis is returned to the prison, his assistant Solly tells him that a week before the incident in the restaurant occurred, he had heard that Louis would be coming back. Louis realizes that he has been framed by Brenner and his pals and deliberately prepares inedible meals for them. Meanwhile, Mrs. Duffy discovers that the restaurant customer was an ex-con and confidence man named Gilbert Lee, alias ""Phil the Hook,"" and tells her husband. Fed up with the poor food, a number of the convicts tell Louis that Brenner planned the whole thing. Louis then threatens Brenner with a meat cleaver and forces him to eat rice pudding covered with ketchup. Later, after Duffy informs Louis that his parole has been reinstated, he hands his chef's hat to Solly and leaves to meet Marie, as Lee joins the prisoners' ranks.

Warden Duffy's second story concerns an attempted prison break from an isolation area: One night, prisoner Chet Harmon feigns illness and Frank, a male orderly and prisoner, is summoned. Frank's brother Al, who is in an adjacent cell, tells Frank that he and Chet are planning a breakout and that he has to help. Frank is reluctant to assist as he just wants to serve his time and leave, but after a new prisoner sows doubts in Frank's mind about his girl friend's faithfulness, he decides to help. Later, while the prison doctor is examining Chet, Frank removes a gun from the doctor's medical bag and slips it into an unoccupied cell. When Frank is on his way out, he attacks a guard named Pete and is put in the cell where he placed the gun. With Al's help, Frank passes the gun to Chet. Another prisoner, Square, is also in on the escape. Three days later, when two members of the prison board, Garvey and Ferness, visit the cells on a routine inspection, Chet uses the gun to take Garvey and Pete prisoner and locks them in a cell. Chet then releases Al, Square and Frank and, using Ferness as a hostage, phones Duffy to demand that a car be delivered to the gate and that they be given a two-hour head start. When Duffy refuses to cooperate, Chet tells the warden that in ten minutes' time he will begin to kill the hostages. Frank wants nothing to do with killing, but while he and Al discuss this, Chet kills Pete and sends his body to Duffy. After Duffy reports to his chief, Square arranges that Duffy come, under a truce, to negotiate. Duffy tells Chet that his chief will be coming within two hours to make a deal. However, Chet then attempts to add Duffy to the hostages, prompting Square, who had given Duffy his word regarding the truce, to tackle Chet. Frank helps but is shot and seriously wounded by Chet, who then kills Square. Duffy says that Frank will die, but refuses to summon the doctor until they abandon the break. When Al, desperate to help his brother, goes to the phone to call the doctor, Chet threatens to shoot him, but Al draws a knife. Chet shoots him, but Al sinks the knife into Chet and they both die.

Duffy's final story is about a prisoner's need to find a purpose in life: When Duffy shows new prison chaplain Father Harvey around the chapel, the priest is saddened to see that a mural of ""The Last Supper"" has been damaged by rusty water pipes. After Shorty, a convict who is to assist Harvey, tells him that a prisoner named Steinberg, who is serving a life sentence for murdering his wife and her lover, is a very fine artist, Harvey persuades Steinberg to repair the mural. Access to the chapel is important to Shorty and his pal Mike as they plan to make bootleg liquor in an attic they can reach only from the chapel. Steinberg agrees to assist their project in return for a cut of the sales. Steinberg, who is an atheist and resents the priest's artistic supervision of his work, begins the restoration work with the face of Simon Peter. When Harvey discovers that the face Steinberg has given Simon Peter is that of a prisoner who was executed on the eve of Harvey's arrival, the priest accuses Steinberg of mocking religion and demands that he be disciplined and lose certain privileges for a week. Later, Steinberg discovers that Shorty and Mike are really planning a breakout via the attic and may take Harvey as a hostage. Steinberg resumes his work and finishes the face of Matthew. Meanwhile, Harvey is concerned about how he will deal with an imminent execution, and when he goes to Charlie Rivers' cell to hear his final confession, he realizes that Steinberg has given Matthew the condemned man's face. After Rivers tells Harvey that he is innocent and begs him to intervene, the priest talks with Duffy, who regrets that he is powerless and states that the horrible thing about capital punishment is that you never can be sure about guilt and innocence. This increases Harvey's anguish and, although he agrees to accompany Rivers to the execution chamber, he collapses on the way. Rivers then tells the priest that he is really guilty and seeks his help on his final journey. That night, Harvey tells Steinberg how Rivers helped him and admits that he has been prejudicial. Later, Shorty, who has become the model for the mural's Judas, Mike and Steinberg take Harvey hostage at gunpoint and attempt to break out. After Mike is killed by guards, Shorty has Harvey phone Duffy to arrange their release, but Duffy tells him that the guards have orders to shoot, regardless of who the hostage may be. Steinberg then tackles Shorty, refusing to permit the possible killing of the priest. Although Shorty mortally wounds him, they continue to struggle until Shorty falls on top of Steinberg and the gun goes off, killing Shorty. Father Harvey prays over Steinberg's body. Later, Harvey engages another artist to finish the mural, with the face of Christ to be Steinberg's.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047524/,"['Oliver Crawford', 'Walter Doniger', 'Clinton T.

After the queen leaves for a promotional tour of America, a long-fomenting revolution erupts on the night of Anne's birthday ball, and the palace is bombed. The king agrees to meet with the revolution's leader and, after hearing his cause, promises him that if the revolutionaries lay down their arms, he will oust General Northrup, the powerful, dictatorial premier. After some manipulation and collaboration, the king rids the country of Northrup, while insuring better living conditions for his subjects. With the uprising squelched and the queen back from America, Anne's wedding to William proceeds as planned, though under protest from the princess.

tt0033691,Harmon of Michigan,1h 5m,Approved,6.7,71,,"Tom Harmon (ol' # 98 for the Michigan Wolverines, husband of actress Elyse Knox and father of Mark Harmon and Kelly Harmon) took a back seat to no one on the football field (except the Minnesota Gophers) or, later, in the broadcast booth, but, on film, he managed to find himself in two of the all-time bad sports movies...""The Spirit of West Point"" and ""Harmon of Michigan."" The latter, if it had been a true-life biography of Tom Harmon, might have made a passable film but after a short prologue, narrated by sports writer Bill Henry who is not the same as actor William Henry, that semi-recaps Harmon's football-playing days at the University of Michigan, it quickly develops into a mess that indicates the director and writers used the technical adviser, Coach Jeff Cravath, only to put plays on the blackboard. Once Harmon,(supposedly playing himself but the character he plays here has more character flaws than the law allows), graduates from Michigan, he marries his college sweetheart Peggy Adams (Anita Louise), turns up his nose at the prospect of playing professional football---a poor-paying and not-that-well respected job in 1941---and starts a vagabond tour of coaching tank-water colleges. Authenicity went out the window when the narration ended, as did any kind of time tracking, as everything that follows seems to happen in a single football season. Tom takes an assistant coach job at a cow-pasture college under Jimmy Wayburn (William Hall) and lasts one day before Wayburn fires him. Then he signs to play for a College All-Star team doing exhibition games against pro teams, but his team-mates, hacked because Tom gets star billing, lay down on him and he gets smacked down hard on every play. One of the leaders willing to let Harmon get slaughtered is old Michigan teammate Forrest Evashevski (playing himself), a life-long friend in real life and Godfather to Mark Harmon and a long-time respected coach at the University of Iowa. Harmon wins the game by himself, but decides this isn't his cup of tea. He hangs around the house a few weeks, then gets a job as an assistant under old-time coach Pop Branch at a college that has three buildings on campus and a football stadium seating 100,000 fans. He helps Pop win a few games (still ticking along in what appears to be the same fall football season), but the alumni at Webster College are tired of losing, fire their coach and hire Harmon away from Pop. Harmon takes over the Webster team in mid-season and becomes the all-time example of a hard-ass coach willing to win at any cost, including installing a screen-pass play that depends on an illegal blocking scheme---the Flying Wedge---to make it work. His Webster team begins to thump their opponents by large scores, usually leaving the other team battered and bloodied by the use of the illegal blocking scheme. They win four or five games which, based on the writers time scheme, would have them playing 20 games a season in what was then a nine-and-ten game season. Plus, the press and other coaches around and about, are up in arms about Harmon's tactics, but the jerks refereeing the games evidently haven't read the rule book nor the newspapers and throw no penalty flags against his team. Well, one referee does once, but he never officiated nor had lunch in that town again. It, by any reasonable calendar must now be July of the next year in a season that should have ended in December, and hard-case Harmon's team is going up against Pop's team (where Harmon coached earlier in this never-ending season) and Pop drops by and tells Tom he ain't all that fond of Tom's coaching methods, but Tom poo-pahs him off, and then sends his team out and they gleefully dismantle Pop's fair-playing team by 109-0. But Webster's quarterback Freddie Davis (Stanley Brown) suffers a concussion running a play Harmon calls just to run up the score even higher---Harmon evidently didn't read the script because nobody using their own name would want this character perceived as Himself---and it's nip-and-tuck whether Freddie will get out of the hospital alive. It gets even stickier when Freddie parents drop their hospital vigil long enough to tell Tom they are right proud that he is Freddie's coach. Say what? Tom sees the light and reverts back to the good old boy he started out as.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033691/,"['Richard Goldstone', 'Stanley Rauh', 'Fredric M.
